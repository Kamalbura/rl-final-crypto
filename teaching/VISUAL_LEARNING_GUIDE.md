## 🎯 **Core RL Concepts - Visualized**

### 🤖 **The RL Loop - How Learning Works**

```
    👤 Agent (Our RL System)
       ↓ 
   ⚡ Action (Choose Algorithm)
       ↓
🌍 Environment (Battery + Threat + Mission)
       ↓
   🏆 Reward (Performance Score)
       ↓
   📚 Learning (Update Knowledge)
       ↓
    (Repeat...)
```

**Real Example**:
- **Agent**: "I need to choose a crypto algorithm"
- **Action**: "I'll pick KYBER (6.2W power consumption)" 
- **Environment**: "Battery: Low, Threat: High, Mission: Critical"
- **Reward**: "+8.5 points - Good choice! Secure but power-efficient"
- **Learning**: "Remember: KYBER works well for low battery + high threat"

## 🗺️ **State Space Visualization**

Our system has **30 states** organized like this:

```
           NORMAL MISSION              CRITICAL MISSION
         ┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
         │ Low Med High    │         │ Low Med High    │
   FULL  │ [1] [2] [3]     │   FULL  │[16][17][18]    │
  HIGH   │ [4] [5] [6]     │  HIGH   │[19][20][21]    │
 MEDIUM  │ [7] [8] [9]     │ MEDIUM  │[22][23][24]    │
    LOW  │[10][11][12]     │    LOW  │[25][26][27]    │
CRITICAL │[13][14][15]     │CRITICAL │[28][29][30]    │
         └─────────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
           Threat Level                 Threat Level
```

**Key Insights**:
- **30 different situations** our agent might encounter
- **Each state needs different optimal action**
- **Patterns**: Critical battery → prefer low-power algorithms
- **Patterns**: High threat → prefer post-quantum algorithms

## ⚖️ **Reward Function - The Scoring System**

```
🎯 TOTAL REWARD = Battery Score + Security Score + Expert Score
                      (40%)           (40%)           (20%)

📋 Example Calculation:
   Situation: Critical Battery, High Threat, Critical Mission
   Action: Choose KYBER (6.2W)
   
   🔋 Battery Score: 7.8/10 (relatively efficient)
   🛡️ Security Score: 10/10 (post-quantum for high threat) 
   🎓 Expert Score: 10/10 (matches expert recommendation)
   
   📊 Total: 0.4×7.8 + 0.4×10 + 0.2×10 = 9.1/10 (Excellent!)
```

**Visual Reward Ranges**:
- **🔥 9-10**: Excellent choice (expert-level)
- **✅ 7-8**: Good choice (solid decision)
- **⚠️ 5-6**: OK choice (room for improvement)  
- **❌ 0-4**: Poor choice (learn to avoid)

---

## 📈 **Learning Progress - From Beginner to Expert**

### **Phase 1: Random Exploration** (Episodes 0-50)
```
Performance: Low and Variable
Reward Range: 10-40 (lots of mistakes)
Agent Thinking: "I'll try random actions to see what happens"

📊 [----X--X-X----XX-----] (scattered, low rewards)
```

### **Phase 2: Active Learning** (Episodes 50-150) 
```
Performance: Steadily Improving  
Reward Range: 30-60 (learning patterns)
Agent Thinking: "I'm starting to see which actions work better"

📊 [-----XX-XXX-XXXX----] (upward trend visible)
```

### **Phase 3: Expert Performance** (Episodes 150+)
```
Performance: High and Stable
Reward Range: 50-80 (consistent good choices) 
Agent Thinking: "I know what to do in most situations"

📊 [-------XXXXXXX------] (high, stable performance)
```

## 🧠 **Q-Learning vs Deep Q-Learning**

### **Q-Learning (Tabular Method)**
```
📊 Q-Table (30 states × 8 actions = 240 values)

        ASCON SPECK HIGHT ... KYBER DILI SPHI FALC
State1   2.1   3.4   2.8  ...  8.9  7.2  6.5  7.8
State2   1.9   2.1   3.2  ...  6.4  8.1  7.9  9.1  
State3   4.2   4.8   4.1  ...  5.2  6.8  5.9  6.3
...      ...   ...   ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...

💡 Each cell = "How good is this action in this state?"
✅ Simple, exact, easy to understand
❌ Doesn't scale to larger problems
```

### **Deep Q-Learning (Neural Network)**
```
🧠 Neural Network (Input: State → Output: Q-values for all actions)

Input Layer     Hidden Layers        Output Layer
[State Info] → [128][64][32] → [Q-vals for 8 actions]
    ↓              ↓                    ↓
[Batt, Thrt,   [Pattern          [6.1, 4.2, 5.8, 
 Mission]       Detection]         7.9, 8.4, 7.1, 6.5, 8.2]

💡 Learns patterns and relationships
✅ Scales to large problems, can generalize
❌ More complex, approximate values
```

## 🎯 **Algorithm Selection Patterns**

### **What Our RL Agent Learned**

```
🔋 BATTERY CRITICAL → Prefer Low Power
   Top Choices: KYBER (6.2W) > ASCON (2.1W)
   Avoid: FALCON (7.1W), SPHINCS (6.8W)

🛡️ THREAT HIGH → Require Post-Quantum  
   Top Choices: KYBER, DILITHIUM, SPHINCS, FALCON
   Avoid: ASCON, SPECK, HIGHT, CAMELLIA

⚡ MISSION CRITICAL → Balance Security vs Efficiency
   Top Choices: KYBER (best of both worlds)
   Consider: DILITHIUM (very secure)

🎯 NORMAL SITUATIONS → Optimize for Efficiency
   Top Choices: ASCON (ultra-low power)
   Secondary: SPECK, HIGHT
```

## 🔍 **Common Questions - Visual Answers**

### **Q: How does the agent "know" what to do?**
```
A: Through the Q-Table/Neural Network:

Initial State: All Q-values = 0 (knows nothing)
After Experience: High Q-values for good actions
Decision: Pick action with highest Q-value

Example:
State: Critical Battery, High Threat
Q-values: [2.1, 3.4, 2.8, 4.1, 8.9←, 7.2, 6.5, 7.8]
Choice: Pick KYBER (index 4, value 8.9) ✅
```

### **Q: Why does performance improve over time?**
```
A: Continuous Learning Cycle:

Try Action → Get Reward → Update Knowledge → Try Better Actions
    ↓            ↓             ↓                ↓
   KYBER      +8.5 pts    Q[state,KYBER]++   Choose KYBER more
```

### **Q: How do we know it's working well?**
```
A: Multiple Success Indicators:

📈 Reward Trend: 20→40→60→70+ (improving)
🎯 Expert Match: 80%+ agreement with humans  
🗺️ State Coverage: Visits all 30 states
⚖️ Smart Choices: KYBER for efficiency, FALCON for security
