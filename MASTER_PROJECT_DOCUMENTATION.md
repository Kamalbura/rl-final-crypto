# 🔬 **3. MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK & MDP FORMULATION**

## Markov Decision Process (MDP) Definition
Our system is formulated as a finite MDP: **M = (S, A, P, R, γ)**

### **3.1 State Space (S)**
**Formal Definition**: S = B × T × M  
Where:
- **B**: Battery levels = {CRITICAL, LOW, MEDIUM, GOOD, HIGH}  
- **T**: Threat status = {NORMAL, CONFIRMING, CONFIRMED}  
- **M**: Mission criticality = {ROUTINE, IMPORTANT}  

**Cardinality**: |S| = 5 × 3 × 2 = 30 states

**State Encoding**:
```
State Index = battery_level × 6 + threat_status × 2 + mission_criticality
```

**Mathematical Representation**:
Each state s ∈ S is represented as:
```
s = (b, t, m) where:
- b ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} (battery discretization)
- t ∈ {0, 1, 2} (threat escalation levels)  
- m ∈ {0, 1} (mission priority binary)
```

### **3.2 Action Space (A)**
**Formal Definition**: A = {a₀, a₁, ..., a₇}  
**Cardinality**: |A| = 8 cryptographic algorithms

**Action Mapping**:
```
Pre-Quantum Algorithms (Legacy):
- a₀: ASCON (2.1W)
- a₁: SPECK (2.8W)  
- a₂: HIGHT (3.2W)
- a₃: CAMELLIA (4.5W)

Post-Quantum Algorithms (Secure):
- a₄: KYBER (6.2W)
- a₅: DILITHIUM (6.5W)
- a₆: SPHINCS (6.8W)  
- a₇: FALCON (7.1W)
```

### **3.3 Transition Dynamics P(s'|s,a)**
**State Transition Probabilities**:

**Battery Drain Model**:
```
P(b'|b,a) = {
    min(0.3, power(a)/20) : b' = max(0, b-1)  [drain]
    1 - min(0.3, power(a)/20) : b' = b        [maintain]
}
```

**Threat Evolution Model**:
```
P(t'|t,a) = {
    0.1 : t' = min(2, t+1)     [escalation]
    0.1 : t' = max(0, t-1)     [de-escalation]  
    0.8 : t' = t               [stable]
}
```

**Mission Transition Model**:
```
P(m'|m,a) = {
    0.05 : m' = 1-m           [criticality change]
    0.95 : m' = m             [stable]
}
```

### **3.4 Reward Function R(s,a)**
**Multi-Objective Reward Design**:

```
R(s,a) = w₁ × R_security(s,a) + w₂ × R_power(s,a) + w₃ × R_expert(s,a)
```

**Component Functions**:

**Security Reward**:
```
R_security(s,a) = {
    +10 : threat = CONFIRMED ∧ algorithm = post-quantum
    +5  : threat = CONFIRMING ∧ algorithm = post-quantum
    +2  : threat = NORMAL ∧ algorithm ∈ {pre-quantum, post-quantum}
    -5  : threat = CONFIRMED ∧ algorithm = pre-quantum
}
```

**Power Efficiency Reward**:
```
R_power(s,a) = {
    +8  : battery = CRITICAL ∧ power(a) ≤ 3.0W
    +5  : battery = LOW ∧ power(a) ≤ 4.0W
    +3  : battery = MEDIUM ∧ power(a) ≤ 5.0W
    +1  : battery ∈ {GOOD, HIGH}
    -2  : power(a) > threshold(battery)
}
```

**Expert Alignment Reward**:
```
R_expert(s,a) = {
    +15 : a = expert_action(s)     [perfect match]
    -10 : a ≠ expert_action(s)     [deviation penalty]
}
```

**Weight Configuration**: w₁ = 0.3, w₂ = 0.4, w₃ = 0.3

# 🗺️ **5. STATE SPACE DESIGN**

## **5.1 State Space Composition**

### **Battery Level Discretization (B)**
**Continuous → Discrete Mapping**:
```
Battery Percentage → Discrete Level:
[0-20%)     → CRITICAL (0): Emergency power conservation required
[20-40%)    → LOW (1): Aggressive power saving needed
[40-60%)    → MEDIUM (2): Balanced power management
[60-80%)    → GOOD (3): Standard operation possible
[80-100%]   → HIGH (4): Full performance available
```

**Design Rationale**:
- **Non-uniform intervals**: Critical region (0-20%) isolated for special handling
- **Operational significance**: Each level corresponds to different power strategies
- **Hardware alignment**: Common battery management system thresholds

### **Threat Status Levels (T)**
```
NORMAL (0):     Standard security posture, no active threats detected
CONFIRMING (1): Potential threat detected, verification in progress  
CONFIRMED (2):  Active threat confirmed, maximum security required
```

**Threat Escalation Model**:
- **Detection systems**: Intrusion detection, anomaly monitoring
- **Confirmation process**: Multi-factor threat verification
- **Response protocol**: Graduated security response

### **Mission Criticality (M)**
```
ROUTINE (0):   Standard operations, normal security acceptable
IMPORTANT (1): Critical mission, enhanced security mandatory
```

**Mission Context Examples**:
- **ROUTINE**: Data logging, periodic updates, maintenance
- **IMPORTANT**: Financial transactions, medical data, security communications

## **5.2 State Space Properties**

### **Completeness Analysis**
✅ **Covers all operational scenarios**:
- Battery degradation cycles (5 levels)
- Security threat spectrum (3 levels)  
- Mission priority range (2 levels)
- Total coverage: 30 distinct operational contexts

### **State Transition Matrix**
**Dimensionality**: 30 × 30 × 8 = 7,200 transition probabilities
**Sparsity**: ~85% sparse (most transitions have zero probability)
**Computation**: Efficient sparse matrix representation

### **State Encoding for Neural Networks**
**One-Hot Encoding**: 10-dimensional vector
```
State Vector = [b₀, b₁, b₂, b₃, b₄, t₀, t₁, t₂, m₀, m₁]
Where only relevant indices = 1, others = 0

Example - State (CRITICAL, CONFIRMED, IMPORTANT):
Vector = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
```

# 🎯 **7. REWARD FUNCTION ENGINEERING**

## **7.1 Multi-Objective Reward Design Philosophy**

The reward function balances three competing objectives:
1. **Security Maximization**: Encourage strong cryptographic protection
2. **Power Minimization**: Preserve battery life for extended operation
3. **Expert Alignment**: Leverage domain expertise for optimal decisions

## **7.2 Detailed Reward Function Mathematics**

### **Complete Reward Function**
```
R(s,a) = α·R_security(s,a) + β·R_battery(s,a) + γ·R_expert(s,a) + δ·R_bonus(s,a)

Where: α + β + γ + δ = 1.0 (normalized weights)
```

### **Security Reward Component R_security(s,a)**
**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
R_security(s,a) = security_multiplier(threat) × algorithm_security_score(a)

security_multiplier(threat) = {
    1.0  : threat = NORMAL
    1.5  : threat = CONFIRMING  
    2.0  : threat = CONFIRMED
}

algorithm_security_score(a) = {
    3.0  : a ∈ {ASCON, SPECK, HIGHT}        [pre-quantum]
    4.0  : a = CAMELLIA                     [enhanced pre-quantum]
    8.0  : a ∈ {KYBER, DILITHIUM}          [post-quantum standard]
    10.0 : a ∈ {SPHINCS, FALCON}           [post-quantum maximum]
}
```

**Example Calculations**:
- **NORMAL threat + KYBER**: R_security = 1.0 × 8.0 = +8.0
- **CONFIRMED threat + FALCON**: R_security = 2.0 × 10.0 = +20.0
- **CONFIRMED threat + SPECK**: R_security = 2.0 × 3.0 = +6.0 (suboptimal)

### **Battery Reward Component R_battery(s,a)**
**Power Efficiency Formula**:
```
R_battery(s,a) = battery_urgency(b) × power_efficiency(a)

battery_urgency(b) = {
    5.0  : b = CRITICAL    [maximum power conservation]
    3.0  : b = LOW         [aggressive power saving]  
    2.0  : b = MEDIUM      [moderate power awareness]
    1.0  : b = GOOD        [standard operation]
    0.5  : b = HIGH        [performance priority]
}

power_efficiency(a) = max_power - power_consumption(a)
max_power = 7.1W (FALCON's consumption)
```

**Power Consumption Values**:
```
power_consumption(a) = {
    2.1W : a = ASCON     → efficiency = 5.0
    2.8W : a = SPECK     → efficiency = 4.3  
    3.2W : a = HIGHT     → efficiency = 3.9
    4.5W : a = CAMELLIA  → efficiency = 2.6
    6.2W : a = KYBER     → efficiency = 0.9
    6.5W : a = DILITHIUM → efficiency = 0.6
    6.8W : a = SPHINCS   → efficiency = 0.3
    7.1W : a = FALCON    → efficiency = 0.0
}
```

### **Expert Alignment Reward R_expert(s,a)**
**Knowledge Transfer Mechanism**:
```
R_expert(s,a) = {
    +15.0 : a = lookup_table[s]     [perfect expert match]
    -5.0  : a ≠ lookup_table[s]     [deviation from expert]
}
```

**Expert Lookup Table Structure**:
```
Expert decisions based on decision tree:
if threat = CONFIRMED:
    if mission = IMPORTANT: return FALCON
    else: return SPHINCS
elif threat = CONFIRMING:
    if battery ≥ MEDIUM: return KYBER
    else: return HIGHT  
else: # threat = NORMAL
    if battery = CRITICAL: return ASCON
    elif battery = LOW: return SPECK
    else: return CAMELLIA
```

### **Bonus Reward Component R_bonus(s,a)**
**Special Scenario Bonuses**:
```
R_bonus(s,a) = mission_bonus(s,a) + efficiency_bonus(s,a)

mission_bonus(s,a) = {
    +5.0 : mission = IMPORTANT ∧ security_score(a) ≥ 8.0
    +2.0 : mission = ROUTINE ∧ power_efficiency(a) ≥ 3.0
    0.0  : otherwise
}

efficiency_bonus(s,a) = {
    +3.0 : perfect_match_for_context(s,a) = True
    0.0  : otherwise  
}
```

## **7.3 Reward Weight Optimization**

### **Weight Selection Process**
1. **Initial Analysis**: Equal weights (α = β = γ = δ = 0.25)
2. **Expert Consultation**: Security experts recommend priority ordering
3. **Empirical Tuning**: Grid search over weight combinations
4. **Validation**: Cross-validation against expert decisions

### **Final Weight Configuration**
```
α = 0.30  # Security weight - High priority for cryptographic integrity
β = 0.40  # Battery weight - Primary optimization target  
γ = 0.25  # Expert weight - Strong guidance from domain knowledge
δ = 0.05  # Bonus weight - Minor adjustments for special cases
```

### **Sensitivity Analysis**
**Weight Variation Impact**:
- **β ± 0.1**: ±5% change in algorithm selection patterns
- **α ± 0.1**: ±8% change in post-quantum algorithm usage
- **γ ± 0.1**: ±12% change in expert alignment accuracy

# 🚀 **9. TRAINING METHODOLOGY**

## **9.1 Q-Learning Training Protocol**

### **Algorithm Implementation**
**Q-Learning Update Rule**:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[R(s,a) + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
                                    a'
Where:
- α = 0.1 (learning rate)
- γ = 0.95 (discount factor)  
- ε = 0.1 → 0.01 (exploration decay)
```

**Training Hyperparameters**:
```
Learning Rate (α): 0.1
    ↳ Rationale: Moderate learning for stable convergence
Discount Factor (γ): 0.95  
    ↳ Rationale: High value for long-term battery preservation
Epsilon Decay: 0.995 per episode
    ↳ Rationale: Gradual shift from exploration to exploitation
Initial Exploration (ε₀): 0.1
Final Exploration (εf): 0.01
```

### **Training Process**
**Phase 1 - Warm-Start Initialization**:
```
1. Load expert lookup table (30 state-action pairs)
2. Initialize Q-table with expert knowledge:
   - Expert actions: Q-value = 10.0
   - Similar actions: Q-value = 5.0  
   - Poor actions: Q-value = -1.0
3. Verification: 100% expert action preference confirmed
```

**Phase 2 - Experience Collection**:
```
For episode in range(1000):
    1. Reset environment to random state
    2. For step in range(100):  # Episode length
        a. Select action using ε-greedy policy
        b. Execute action, observe reward and next state
        c. Update Q-table using Q-learning rule
        d. Track performance metrics
    3. Decay exploration rate: ε = ε × 0.995
    4. Log episode reward and convergence metrics
```

**Phase 3 - Policy Refinement**:
```
1. Reduce exploration to minimum (ε = 0.01)
2. Fine-tune Q-values through exploitation
3. Validate against expert recommendations
4. Final policy extraction: π(s) = argmax Q(s,a)
                                     a
```

### **Q-Learning Convergence Analysis**
**Convergence Metrics**:
- **Bellman Error**: |Q(s,a) - [R(s,a) + γ max Q(s',a')]| < 0.01
                                              a'
- **Policy Stability**: π(s) unchanged for 10 consecutive episodes
- **Performance Plateau**: Average reward variance < 5% over 50 episodes

**Training Results Summary**:
```
Total Episodes: 1000
Convergence Episode: ~58
Final Average Reward: 39.01 ± 37.11
Expert Alignment: 96.7%
Training Duration: ~15 seconds per 1000 episodes
```
