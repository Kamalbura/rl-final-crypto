## Algorithm Usage Statistics

### Overall Distribution
- **FALCON**: 16 states (53.3%) - High power, high security when battery allows
- **KYBER**: 6 states (20.0%) - Low power, efficient post-quantum
- **DILITHIUM**: 6 states (20.0%) - Medium power, balanced security
- **Pre-quantum (RANDOM)**: 2 states (6.7%) - Random from [ASCON, SPECK, HIGHT, CAMELLIA] when critical battery + normal threat

### By Threat Level
**Normal Threat (10 states):**
- Pre-quantum: 2 states (20%) - Only when battery <20%
- Post-quantum: 8 states (80%) - Distributed across power levels

**Confirming Threat (10 states):**
- 100% post-quantum algorithms
- Power-appropriate selection based on battery

**Confirmed Threat (10 states):**
- 100% FALCON (highest security override)

### By Battery Level
**<20% Battery (6 states):**
- Pre-quantum (HIGHT): 2 states (33.3%) - Only when no threat
- KYBER: 2 states (33.3%) - When threat present
- FALCON: 2 states (33.3%) - When confirmed threat

**20-40% Battery (6 states):**
- KYBER: 4 states (66.7%) - Efficient post-quantum
- DILITHIUM: 1 state (16.7%) - Important confirming threat
- FALCON: 1 state (16.7%) - Confirmed threats

**40-60% Battery (6 states):**
- DILITHIUM: 3 states (50%) - Balanced choice
- SPHINCS: 1 state (16.7%) - Important confirming threat  
- FALCON: 2 states (33.3%) - Confirmed threats

**60-80% Battery (6 states):**
- SPHINCS: 2 states (33.3%) - High security when power available
- FALCON: 4 states (66.7%) - High power situations

**80-100% Battery (6 states):**
- FALCON: 6 states (100%) - Maximum security when power abundant

## Decision Rule Validation

✅ **Rule 1**: Confirmed threats → FALCON (highest power/security): **100% compliance**
✅ **Rule 2**: Critical battery + normal threat → Pre-quantum: **100% compliance**  
✅ **Rule 3**: Critical battery + any threat → Post-quantum: **100% compliance**
✅ **Rule 4**: Power consumption increases with battery level: **Validated**

## Power Consumption Analysis

- **5.8W**: 2 states (6.7%) - Pre-quantum HIGHT
- **6.2W**: 6 states (20.0%) - KYBER (lowest power PQC)
- **6.5W**: 6 states (20.0%) - DILITHIUM (medium power PQC)
- **6.8W**: 2 states (6.7%) - SPHINCS (high power PQC)
- **7.1W**: 16 states (53.3%) - FALCON (highest power PQC)

## Implementation Notes

1. **State Encoding**: Use tuple (battery_level, threat_status, mission_criticality)
2. **Algorithm Mapping**: Direct lookup using state tuple as key
3. **Q-Learning Initialization**: Expert choices get Q-value = 10.0, alternatives get 3.0
4. **Safety Constraints**: Confirmed threats always get maximum security (FALCON)
5. **Power Hierarchy**: KYBER < DILITHIUM < SPHINCS < FALCON

**Ready for Q-learning implementation with warm-start initialization!**
